HfG Documentation Generator - Kirby V3 Port  ‚ö†Ô∏è
==========================

Simple web documentation generator based on [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/).

The documentation generator aims to solve the typical student documentation needs of courses at the HfG Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd.

ü§ñ How to create a documentation
--------------------------------

**macOS**

* Download this repository
* Unzip the package
* Move the unpacked folder somewhere on your hard drive, e.g. "~/Desktop/my-documentation"
* Double click `_start-php.command`. 
* (You might have to give permission to [open an app from an unidentified developer](https://support.apple.com/kb/ph25088?locale=en_US))
* This will open "localhost:8000" in your browser ... you can start editing via `http://localhost:8000/panel`

**Windows**

* Install and start a local Apache server like [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/de/downloads/) that supports PHP 7.1+. XAMPP would be an alternative, but doesn't seem to support all needed PHP features.
* Download this repository
* Unzip the package
* Move the unpacked folder inside your webserver folder, e.g. "C:\MAMP\htdocs\"
* You may rename the folder "hfg-documentation-generator-master" to something shorter, e.g. "my-documentation"
* Open the url `http://localhost/my-documentation` in your browser ... you can start editing via `http://localhost/my-documentation/panel`

üë©‚Äçüé® Supported media
------------------
You will write and edit your content in [Kirby Markdown](https://getkirby.com/docs/content/text). Supported media: videos, Vimeo videos, YouTube videos, p5.js sketches, text, images and images with captions.

üåç Hosting documentations online
--------------------------------
In case you want to have a documentation online under your own domain ... please make sure to follow first these steps:

1. [Buy](https://getkirby.com/buy) your own Kirby license
2. Delete the default "student" user (site/accounts/student.php) and create your own user.
